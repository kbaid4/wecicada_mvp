### Core Components
- `CookieConsent`: Displays the cookie consent banner

### Utility Functions

## How It Works

1. **First Visit**: The cookie consent banner is displayed, requiring user action.
2. **User Choice**: Users can:
   - Accept all cookies
   - Reject non-essential cookies
   - Customize their preferences
3. **Storage**: Preferences are saved in localStorage and as a cookie for server-side access.
4. **Respect**: The application respects the user's choices for analytics and marketing features.

## Adding to Your Application

1. The cookie consent banner is automatically included in the main `App` component.
2. Use the `PrivacyPolicyLink` and `PrivacySettingsLink` components in your footer or navigation.
3. Import and use the `useCookieConsent` hook to check user preferences in your components.

## Customization

### Styling
- Styles are located in `src/styles/privacy.css`
- Colors can be customized by updating the CSS variables
